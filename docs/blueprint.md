# **App Name**: SCAGO Feedback

## Core Features:

- Feedback Submission Form: A detailed form for users to submit their experiences and insights related to sickle cell disease care and support. The form should accommodate both structured (e.g., ratings, multiple-choice) and unstructured (free text) responses.
- Anonymous Submission Option: Users can choose to submit their feedback anonymously to ensure privacy and encourage honest responses. If selected, personal identifiers will be removed from the submission.
- Educational Resources: Access to educational resources, news, and updates provided by the Sickle Cell Awareness Group of Ontario. Resources will be fetched directly from the group's website and displayed in an accessible format.
- Sentiment Analysis Tool: Employ an AI-powered tool that analyzes the submitted text feedback, detecting negative or positive emotions and identifying recurrent topics and ideas in the input.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft, muted red (#D34040) to evoke empathy and represent the cause.
- Background color: Slightly off-white (#F9F6F6) to create a clean, approachable feel. A light glassmorphism effect to soften contrast and suggest clarity and depth.
- Accent color: Black (#000000) to provide neutral highlights without distracting from the primary and background colors.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans' a modern sans-serif font to ensure excellent readability.
- Use clean, minimalist icons in the primary red color to represent various aspects of the app, such as forms, resources, and submission options.
- A clean and straightforward layout to guide users through the feedback submission process and access educational content, with forms and key information highlighted for ease of use.
- Subtle animations, such as smooth transitions and loading indicators, to enhance user experience without overwhelming the design.
